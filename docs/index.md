`RAGBOT` is a command-line tool designed for running and evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbots. Developed as part of a bachelor thesis project, it supports the creation of intelligent virtual assistants through flexible experimentation and principled evaluation.

Built atop the powerful `LangChain` framework and integrated with `LangSmith` for seamless experiment tracking and logging, `RAGBOT` offers a complete workflow for iterating on RAG pipelines.

The tool provides a structured and extensible framework that enables:

- Interactive development and testing of RAG chatbot configurations.
- Customizable control over fine-tuning parameters, LLM selection, embedding strategies, and retriever behavior.
- Lightweight, modular evaluation inspired by the `RAGAS` frameworkâ€”yet more affordable and adaptable to diverse experimentation needs.

Evaluation in `RAGBOT` combines multiple methodologies, including:

- LLM-as-a-judge techniques for subjective assessments,
- Embedding-based similarity scoring,
- And additional custom metrics for deeper analysis.

Whether you're optimizing a chatbot's responses or conducting rigorous academic evaluations, `RAGBOT` offers the tools to explore, refine, and understand the behavior of modern RAG systems from the command line.
